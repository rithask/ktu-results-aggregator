# KTU Grade Aggregator

Find all your semester results at one place. Built with simple UI/UX in mind.

## Motivation

Navgating through the KTU's official website to find your results is a pain. This projects aims to solve that problem by providing a simple UI to find all your semester results at one place. You can even see the SGPA and CGPA even if you have failed in any subject which KTU doesn't provide.
